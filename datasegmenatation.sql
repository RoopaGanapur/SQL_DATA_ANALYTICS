Performance Analysis (Year-over-Year, Month-over-Month)
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.
    - For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.
    - To track yearly trends and growth.

SQL Functions Used:
    - LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.
    - AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.
    - CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

Cumulative Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To calculate running totals or moving averages for key metrics.
    - To track performance over time cumulatively.
    - Useful for growth analysis or identifying long-term trends.

SQL Functions Used:
    - Window Functions: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER()
